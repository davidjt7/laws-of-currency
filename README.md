The 3 Laws of Currency

1. Supply Dilution Favors Those Closest to the Source

Whoever prints or mints first, profits most. Everyone else gets inflation or devaluation.

In fiat: central banks, bondholders, top-tier institutions.

In crypto: founders, insiders, seed investors.

Money has velocity. Power has position.

2. The Rich Always Get the Best Rescue Packages

When systems collapse, they save themselves — not you.

Bailouts go to corporations and banks, not individuals.

Protocol hacks get refunded if whales are involved.

Retail is left holding the bag.

Too big to fail → Too small to matter.

3. Latecomers Bear the Risk

Those who arrive late pay the premium and take the fall.

In fiat: inflation eats away stagnant wages and savings.

In crypto: late buyers fund early exits.

In markets: FOMO in, panic out.

The early fish eat. The late fish fund.

Optional Law 4: All Currencies Eventually Become Political

Whoever controls the supply, controls the story.

Interest rates, sanctions, and tokenomics are all levers of power.
